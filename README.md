# Linked-Lists-in-Assembly
Using MARS Simulator and MIPS 32 Bit assembly language, implemented functions for a linked list data structure and representing a deck of playing cards as a linked list

Functions written in Proj4.asm, to run a function use the "function_name.asm" file and for ease, arguments are located in the args file Just place those arguments in the .data section of the "function_name.asm" you are attemping to use
